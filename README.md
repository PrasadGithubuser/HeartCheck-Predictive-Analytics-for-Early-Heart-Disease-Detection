# HeartCheck-Predictive-Analytics-for-Early-Heart-Disease-Detection
📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. HeartCheck is a predictive analytics system that uses machine learning algorithms to detect early signs of heart disease. By analyzing patient data, such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, our model provides insights to healthcare professionals for early intervention.

🚀 Features
✔ Machine Learning-based Prediction – Uses Random Forest and other models to predict heart disease risk.
✔ User-Friendly GUI – Allows users to input medical data and receive instant predictions.
✔ High Accuracy – Achieves improved accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.
✔ Feature Importance Analysis – Identifies key health indicators contributing to heart disease.
✔ Scalability – Can handle large medical datasets efficiently.
